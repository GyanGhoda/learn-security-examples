The vulnerability lies in how the application determines whether a user is authorized to update roles. It simply checks if the user, whose ID is received in the request body, has an admin role. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a request with the ID of an admin user, thus bypassing the intended security check and gaining the ability to change any user's role. The secure version prevents this by using express-session. Instead of relying on the user ID sent in the request body, it checks the session data for the user ID, ensuring that the request comes from a logged-in session. Additional security checks can also be included by including input validation and sanitization by checking if values like userID and newRole are valid inputs. Additionally, secure session management can also be used in order to ensure there are no session vulnerabilities in the application.
