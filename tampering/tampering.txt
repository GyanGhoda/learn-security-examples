The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of user inputs. Specifically, the possibility of an XSS attack due to the the user input from req.body.name being directly stored in the req.session.user without any sanitization or validation. The secure version of the file fixes this issue by the escapeHTML function, which replaces characters with their respective HTML entities. In terms of CIA properties, integerity is violated as user input is not validated and sanitized which means the integerity of the system is comprimised due to possible malicious user input injection.
