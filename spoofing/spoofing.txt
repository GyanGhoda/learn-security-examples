Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability in the insecure file is related to session cookie configuration. Specifically, it addresses the lack of security settings in the session cookie, which could lead to potential security risks. The secure version prevents this vulnerability by ensuring that the session cookie is not availabile on the client side and specifies how the cookie should be sent to the server. In terms of CIA violations, spoofing violates all three properties of CIA. For confidentiality, when a malicious actor successfully spoofs their identity, they might gain access to systems, networks, or data that they should not have access to. In terms of integrity, by impersonating a trusted entity, a spoofed attacker can manipulate or alter data as it is transmitted across a network. In terms of availabilty, spoofing attacks can impact the availability of services or resources, such as with a DDoS attack.
